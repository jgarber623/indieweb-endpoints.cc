## Usage

There are a couple of ways you can use IndieWeb Endpoints:

You may point your browser at [the website](https://indieweb-endpoints.cc), enter a URL into the search form, and submit! You could also hack on the URL itself and throw something like this at your browser's URL bar:

```text
https://indieweb-endpoints.cc/u/https://sixtwothree.org
```

Lastly, if you're comfortable working on the command line, you can query the service directly using a tool like [curl](https://curl.haxx.se):

```sh
curl --header "Accept: application/json" --silent "https://indieweb-endpoints.cc/u/https://sixtwothree.org"
```

â€¦or [Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/):

```sh
wget --header "Accept: application/json" --quiet -O - "https://indieweb-endpoints.cc/u/https://sixtwothree.org"
```

The above command will return a [JSON](https://json.org) object with the results of the search:

```json
{
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://indieauth.com/auth",
  "micropub": null,
  "microsub": "https://aperture.p3k.io/microsub/219",
  "redirect_uri": [
    "https://sixtwothree.org/auth"
  ],
  "token_endpoint": "https://tokens.indieauth.com/token",
  "webmention": "https://sixtwothree.org/webmentions"
}
```
